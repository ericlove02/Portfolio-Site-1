    <p>As the coronavirus pandemic began to reach its peak in our area and around the United States, my friend and I embarked on a project that we thought would make use of our knowledge to help the people around us. The P-Vent portable ventilator began as a device intended solely to relieve healthcare works from manually pumping a BVM, or bag valve mask, but soon became a low-budget device, ready for field use. The ventilator went through 5 generations, all with new and different features. In the end, the device was machined from high density poly ethylene, for it's high strength and ease to cut, featured an arduino for the brain, potentiometers and an lcd screen for controls, and a stepper with a rack and pinion arm to mimic a hand squeezing a bag. The body of the device was cut into several flat pieces that could be slotted together. The front plate of the device housed all of the electronics, making them easily removable and leaving the shell easy to disenfect for reuse. The total device cost was just under $100 and used only readily available parts.</p>
	<p>More information about the project can be found below:</p>

	  <p>For this project, I took on the role of Head of Programming and Electronics. In this role, I led a team of programmers from around our state through video calls to work on the device software. The device runs off of an Arduino UNO, meaning it is programmed using arduinos language, which is a mix of C and C++. The teams shared all project files through GitHub. As the head of electornics, I also did a lot of soldering and basic circuitry for this project. The device was built around the arduino, which connected to a stepper motor controller, an LCD screen, various switches and sensors, as well as some other components. This role required use of electrical knowledge, as well as some work in SketchUp to map out the electronics rack.</p>
	  <p>The (now open source) code for this project can be found <a href="pvent.html">here</a>.</p>
	  <p>Our ventilator was tested by several medical professionals, including military clinics and local hospitals, and has been under consideration by groups such as the US military, native american tribes surrounding Texas, and Arduino.</p>

    <p>I developed the MUNSA app when I was working for Model United Nations San Antonio as the USG of IT. I was in charge of all of the online material, in the past mostly meaning the website. However, I decided it would be easier for conference attendees to access import information from their smart phones. The app was developed in Xcode, written in Swift. It gave users an easy way to navigate all aspects of the conference, right out of their pocket.</p>
    <p>A few of the .swift files from the project can be found <a href="munsaApp.html">here</a>. In addition, MUNSA also dealt with a lot of delegates, sponsors, and chairs, demanding a large database and mass emailing. One program I wrote to help with this was a JavaScript software that applied Google Apps Scripts to pull data from a Google Sheet and automatically invoice sponsors. The code for this software can be found <a href="MUNSAInvoice.html">here</a>.</p>

	  <img src="images/munsaImg/sch.PNG" alt="munsaSS" class="munimg"/>
	  <img src="images/munsaImg/info.PNG" alt="munsaSS" class="munimg"/>
		 </div>
	  <p>This app was my first time using Xcode and Swift, however I was able to learn the tools and launch the first version of the app in a little over a month. This project showed my willingness to take on new technologies and problem solving abilities. The MUNSA app is made up of several views including a contact list, a map of the conference rooms, information about each committee room, schedules, and updates from the conference organizers. The map view has each room tha tis used for the conference marked, and each can be clicked on to get direction form your current location. The info view contains a list of numerous resources a user may need during the confernece. This includes a list of every committee, containing pictures of the committee chairs, topic, location, and background papers, room assignments, flow of debate charts, procedure notes, and resources for writing resolution papers. The schedule view holds organzie tables of the each time slot and the happenings based upon you scheduling group. Lastly, the updates view displayed new messages from myself, whether it was reminders on app use, notices on where to be at the time, or simply thank you messages for attending.</p>
	  <p>The app was designed to be easy to use, interactive, and full of useful information. Throughout the two day event, the app was well talked about and found to be a useful tool for the 1000+ attendants. The app has nearly 500 downloads and a rating of 4.7 in the app store. </p>
	  <p>The app is no longer available in the App Store, as I no longer work for MUNSA, however a duplicate of the app store posting can be found <a href="https://findourapp.com/app/munsa" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

    <p>I high school I began competing with a local club robotics team in the Marine Advanced Technologies Education, or MATE, competitions. With this team, I help design, build, and program an underwater ROV, capable of completing precision tasks as efficiently as possible.</p>
	  <p>I served the team as the Chief Technical Officer, carrying out majority of the electrical and programming work, and later as the Chief Executive Officer, retaining my past duties while also leading the team meetings and members task progressions.</p>
	  <div class="media">
	  <img src="images/mateImg/deck.jpg" alt="deck" class="mateimg"/>
	  <img src="images/mateImg/team.jpg" alt="team" class="mateimg"/>
	  <img src="images/mateImg/rov.jpg" alt="rov" class="mateimg"/>
	  </div>
	  <p>Our robot was designed around a task briefing resleased by MATE each year. Some of the task included detecting object composition, recognizing species, nagiviagting small spaces, and lifting large objects. Our ROV was designed with aspects built in to take on each mission. Our robot, "Frosty," was equipped with a 1080p HD, low-light camera, allowing it to see clearly it dark waters. It was tethered to a computer at the surface taking input from an Xbox controller. Our software could manipulate the input and send signals to the ROV several yards away. To complete most missions, Frosty had a worm gear driven claw, giving it high torque and an inability to back out. It also had mission specific add-ons, such as a micro ROV that could be deployed from inside the body to naviagte the smaller spaces. The micro ROV was tether to the primary and was equipped with a camera and motor that could be viewed and controlled from the surface. Frosty had many mission specific hardware, but was also equipped with mission specific software, such as image recognition software and autonomous driving.</p>
	  <p>In my roles as Chief Technical Officer, I did a lot of the electrical and programming work. I designed, CADed, and assembled our electrical system, featuring a top end set up, and a brain on the ROV. At the top end, a laptop controller most of the function of the robot. A Xbox controller connected to the computer to take inputs from the driver, which then ran through a software called QGroundControl, a software designed for fpv drones, changed the input for the ROV to run. The computer then connected to a set of board that converted the data into a two wire connection that could be tethered the the ROV. In the brain of the ROV, the data was unpacked via a raspberry pi and drone flight controller. This electronic set up allowed our ROV to be very adaptable to any tasks that required addition or programable features. Some addition that I made to the ROV programming include a shape recognition code, which used Python and the OpenCV library to take images from the camera, recognize the shapes, and return the count, an autonomous flight code, which used an interface inside of QGroundControl, Python, and more OpenCV to recognize the area it needed to operate in and controller the thruster outputs, and lastly a more complex recognition program that was never used in competition due to the season be cancelled for Covid.</p>
	  <p>One of the many softwares I wrote for this competition was a simple image recognition software that used the camera output to recognize and return a count of shapes. This software can be found <a href="mateImgRecognition.html">here</a>.</p>
	  <p>In competition, our ROV was piloted by a main pilot and a co-pilot. I often served as the co-pilot, reading out data, mission plans, and controlling the micro ROV. Our team placed first at our Texas Regional and placed as high as 18th, among approximately 100 teams, at the MATE World Championships.</p>
	  <p>This project gave me the chance to collaborate with a team on a common goal, and later on practice my leadership skills leading a team. It also allowed me to work with new types of software and libraries.</p><br><br>
